    <h2>PARKOUR</h2>
    <div>
        Parkour (French: [paʁkuʁ]) is an athletic training discipline or sport in which practitioners (called traceurs)
        attempt
        to get from one point to another in the fastest and most efficient way possible, without assisting equipment and
        often
        while performing feats of acrobatics.[7] With roots in military obstacle course training and martial arts,
        parkour
        includes flipping, running, climbing, swinging, vaulting, jumping, plyometrics, rolling, and quadrupedal
        movement—whatever is suitable for a given situation.[8][9] Parkour is an activity that can be practiced alone or
        with
        others, and is usually carried out in urban spaces, though it can be done anywhere.

        Although a traceur may perform a flip as well as other aesthetic acrobatic movements, these are not essential to
        the
        discipline.[14] Rather, they are central to freerunning, a discipline derived from parkour but emphasising
        artistry
        rather than efficiency.

        Parkour was established by David Belle in the 1980s, and it was initially called l'art du
        déplacement;[15][16][17]
        however the name "le parcours" had already been given to the activity by 1989.[5] The discipline was popularised
        in the
        1990s and 2000s through films, documentaries, video games, and advertisements.[15][18][19] Similar techniques
        were known
        from French military obstacle courses,[15] and some authors see influence from Hong Kong cinema and Asian
        martial arts
        in Parkour.
        <div class="absolute">
            The word parkour derives from parcours du combattant (obstacle course), the classic obstacle course method
            of military
            training proposed by Georges Hébert.[22][23][24] Raymond Belle used the term "les parcours" to encompass all
            of his
            training including climbing, jumping, running, balancing, and the other methods he undertook in his personal
            athletic
            advancement.[25] His son, David, further developed his father's methods and achieved success as a stuntman,
            and one day
            on a film set showed his 'Speed Air Man' video to Hubert Koundé. Koundé suggested he change the "c" of
            "parcours" to a
            "k" because it was stronger and more dynamic, and to remove the silent "s" for the same reason, forming
            "parkour".[26]

            According to Sebastien Foucan, the activity had already been given the name "le parcours" by the year
            1989.[5]

            A practitioner of parkour is called a traceur, with the feminine form being traceuse or simply a
            "Parkourist".[8] They
            are nouns derived from the French verb tracer, which normally means "to trace", as in "tracing a path", in
            reference to
            drawing.[27] The verb tracer used familiarly means: "to hurry up".[28] The term traceur was originally the
            name of a
            parkour group headed by David Belle which included Sébastien Foucan and Stéphane Vigroux.[29]

            A jam refers to a meeting of traceurs, involving training lasting anywhere from hours to several days, often
            with people
            from different cities. The first parkour jam was organised in July 2002 by Romain Drouet, with a dozen
            people including
            Sébastien Foucan and Stéphane Vigroux.
